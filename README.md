Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree

2020/4 - 

Include projects:

* Deploy a People Counter App at the Edge
In this project, the Intel OpenVINO Toolkit is used to build the People Counter application, which includes inference on input video, extraction and analysis of output data, and then sending the data to the server. The model will be deployed on the edge, so that only the following data is sent to the MQTT server: 1) the number of people in the framework, 2) the time spent by those in the framework, and 3) the total counted. Inference will be done on the local computer.

* Exercise
1. CPU_and_the_DevCloud
Practice requesting the CPU on Intel DevCloud and loading the model.
